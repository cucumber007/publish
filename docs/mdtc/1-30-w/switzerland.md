## UDP

Switzerland can be considered a UDP due to its mountainous terrain, which limited agricultural expansion but provided natural defenses and access to key resources like timber and water.

## SADAT Timeline

SADAT changes in Switzerland were driven by innovations in agriculture, water management, and trade, as well as its strategic neutrality.

| 1521 | Export of Swiss mercenaries increases economic resources, indirectly enhancing SADAT.                           |
| 1536 | The Reformation leads to internal divisions but also stimulates intellectual and technological advancements.    |
| 1618 | Switzerland's neutrality during the Thirty Years' War preserves its resources and stability, maintaining SADAT. |
| 1648 | Recognition of Swiss independence solidifies its position as a neutral and resourceful region.                  |

## Measuring SADAT in Switzerland

To measure SADAT in the context of Switzerland, follow these steps:

1. **Identify key resources**:

   - **Food**: Assess the productivity of alpine agriculture, including dairy farming and grain cultivation.
   - **Water**: Evaluate the availability of rivers and streams for irrigation, drinking, and powering mills.
   - **Timber**: Quantify the forested areas available for construction, fuel, and trade.

2. **Map resources to key technologies**:

   - **Water management**: Link rivers and streams to irrigation systems and mills.
   - **Agricultural innovations**: Connect arable land to crop rotation and selective breeding practices.
   - **Timber usage**: Relate forest resources to construction and fuel technologies.

3. **Calculate the weighted sum**:

   - Assign weights to each resource based on its importance to the local economy and population support.

4. **Divide by population**:
   - Divide the weighted sum of resources by the population of Switzerland to determine the per capita SADAT.

This approach highlights Switzerland's reliance on sustainable resource management and its ability to maintain stability through efficient use of limited resources.

## Key resources and technologies timeline

### Key resources:

- **Food**: Switzerland relied on alpine agriculture, including dairy farming and grain cultivation, to sustain its population.
