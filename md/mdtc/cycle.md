# Basic cycle of technological civilization

1. [Modern](modern.md) - a period of rapid technological and social change
2. [Smuta](smuta.md) - a period of social and political instability
3. [Stable development](stable.md) - a period of relative stability and gradual change

| Period             | Priority of Resources                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modern             | Non-renewable resources                                          |
| Smuta              | Mixed (caused by the transition from non-renewable to renewable) |
| Stable development | Renewable resources                                              |

Non-renewable give a temporary much greater speed of development because in unlocks the temporary boost the science progress in [key technologies](key-tech.md).

The SADAT is required for development, especially during moderns. If there is enough of it (e.g. America is discovered), the people start to actively (and aggressively) explore it. If there is not enough SADAT, the people start to fight each other for the available SADAT (e.g. World War II - Juri Gagarin didn't discover the new "America" in SADAT).

The discoveries of new SADAT ease the wars and give the energy a way to exit the system and be applied to the development of the new SADAT.

Each modern seem to be have the information revolution closer to the end. The information revolution is a period of rapid technological and social change caused by the introduction of new information technologies.

The theory assumes a non-linear progression of "modern," "smuta," and "stable development," which may have overlapping or cyclical patterns and depend on the place where the params are measured (like a water flow), but for the sake of simplicity, the theory is presented in a semi-linear "single-wave" format.

The moderns are period of development that is similar to laminar flow in water and gases, and the smutas are similar to turbulent flow.

- Unknown stable development (Stable development)

  - ???

- Age of Enlightenment / Industrial Revolution (Modern)

  - 1760 – 2020
  - 1890 - if the new America was discovered near this period, there wouldn't be World War I (more SADAT would be available for development)
  - Great Depression wasn't a smuta but more of a future-shock of the fast technological development
  - 1920
    - After World War I, companies that made tanks started making tractors
    - It increased labor productivity
    - Large amount of farmers became unnecessary
    - Unemployment
    - People fled to the USA
    - 1923 - US closed the borders for migrants
    - If that wouldn't happen, there probably wouldn't be World War II (more SADAT would be available for development)
  - 1930
    - Dust storms in the USA due to the messed-up use of agricultural land
    - Classic of moderns - total burn out of resources aiming to get the maximum speed of development
  - Information revolution
    - 1910 – 2020
    - Telegraph
    - Radio
    - Television
    - Internet

- Second Thirty Years War (Smuta)
  - 2020 – 2050?
