This section describes the Model of the Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC) and its key concepts.

[Basic cycle of technological civilization](cycle.md)

The MDTC theory posits that the development of civilizations follows a cyclical pattern driven by the interaction between technological progress, resource availability, and social structures. The three main phases of this cycle are Modern, Smuta, and Stable Development.

- **Modern**: A period of rapid technological and social change, characterized by the consolidation of power and the exploitation of non-renewable resources to accelerate development.
- **Smuta**: A transitional phase marked by instability, as societies struggle to adapt to the depletion of non-renewable resources, absense of SADAT for getting new resources, and the limitations of existing technologies.
- **Stable Development**: A phase of relative equilibrium, where societies rely on renewable resources and maintain slower, more sustainable progress.

The theory emphasizes the importance of "SADAT" (resources available for development with current technology) and "key technologies" (those that significantly increase labor efficiency) in shaping the trajectory of civilizations.

смута останавливается не из-за грандиозной идеи или проекта
а в качестве фиксации момента когда дальше падать уже некуда
"лежит на своей ресурсной базе"
