# Netherlands during the First Thirty Years War

The Netherlands' trajectory during the First Thirty Years War illustrates the potential for innovation and economic transformation during turmoil periods in the MDTC framework.

## Context

- **Independence struggle**: The Netherlands was engaged in the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) against Spain, seeking independence.
- **Economic transformation**: The Dutch Republic became a global trading and financial hub, leveraging its maritime and commercial expertise.
- **Key technologies**: The Dutch excelled in shipbuilding, navigation, and financial innovations, enabling them to dominate global trade.

## Analysis in MDTC Terms

The Netherlands can be considered a UDP after the Age of Discovery (1400s–1600s), as its marshy terrain and lack of natural resources initially posed significant challenges to development. However, these constraints were overcome through technological and economic innovation.

### Migration

- The Netherlands became a destination for skilled migrants, including religious refugees (e.g., Huguenots from France) who contributed to its economic and technological development.
  - This migration occurred primarily in the late 1500s and early 1600s, particularly after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572) and during the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598).
- Internal migration from rural areas to urban centers like Amsterdam fueled the growth of trade and industry.
  - This trend accelerated during the late 1500s and early 1600s as cities became hubs of commerce and innovation.

### Key Technologies in terms of MDTC

- **Water power**: The Dutch utilized windmills and advanced water management systems to reclaim land and support agriculture.
  - These innovations were developed and widely implemented during the 1500s and 1600s, particularly as part of the Dutch Golden Age (1580s–1670s).
- **Shipbuilding**: The Dutch became leaders in shipbuilding technology, creating more SADAT for them.

### Key Resources

- **Food**: The Netherlands imported grain from the Baltic region, ensuring food security despite limited arable land.
  - This trade was most prominent during the 1500s and 1600s, facilitated by the Dutch dominance in maritime trade.
- **Energy**: Peat was a critical energy resource, used for heating and industrial processes.
  - Peat extraction and usage were significant from the late 1500s onward.

### Population Density

- The Netherlands had one of the highest population densities in Europe, which necessitated efficient land use and resource management.
  - By the early 1600s, during the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), the Netherlands had a population density of approximately 50–60 people per square kilometer, one of the highest in Europe.
- Urbanization and trade networks helped mitigate the pressures of high population density by creating economic opportunities.
  - _Where they migrated?_: Migration primarily occurred from rural areas to urban centers such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Leiden, which became economic and cultural hubs during this period.

## Current Context

- **Resource abundance**: Ukraine has fertile agricultural land, significant energy resources, and a strategic location as a transit hub between Europe and Asia.
- **Geopolitical significance**: Ukraine's position makes it a focal point of competition between global powers, particularly the West and Russia.
- **Challenges**: Political instability, corruption, and the ongoing conflict with Russia have hindered Ukraine's ability to fully capitalize on its resources.

## Role During the Second Thirty Years War (2020–2050)

### Key Factors:

1. **Development of UDP**: Ukraine is one of the key UDPs being actively developed during the turmoil. Overcoming historical and structural challenges will be critical to unlocking its potential.
2. **Favourable country characteristics**: Ukraine's resource-to-population ratio positions it as a favourable country, capable of maintaining stability and fostering development during the turmoil.
3. **Migration dynamics**: Ukraine may experience both emigration (due to conflict and economic challenges) and immigration (as a destination for displaced populations from less favourable regions).

### Forecast:

- **Short-term (2020–2030)**:

  - Continued conflict with Russia will dominate the geopolitical landscape.
  - Efforts to integrate with European markets and institutions will accelerate, providing access to capital and technology.
  - Agricultural and energy sectors will see significant investment, driven by global demand for food and energy security.

- **Mid-term (2030–2040)**:

  - Ukraine will emerge as a regional power, leveraging its resources and strategic location.
  - Decentralization and local governance reforms will strengthen internal stability.
  - Migration patterns will stabilize, with Ukraine becoming a destination for skilled workers and refugees from less favourable regions.

- **Long-term (2040–2050)**:
  - Ukraine will transition into a key player in the global renewable energy market, capitalizing on its natural resources and technological advancements.
  - The country will serve as a model for successful UDP development, demonstrating the potential for transformation during turmoil periods.
  - By the end of the Second Thirty Years War, Ukraine will be well-positioned to enter the Stable Development phase, with a diversified economy and strong social cohesion.

## Implications for the Region

Ukraine's trajectory will have significant implications for the broader region:

- **Eastern Europe**: Ukraine's success could inspire similar transformations in neighboring countries, fostering regional stability.
- **Global powers**: The competition for influence in Ukraine will shape the strategies of global powers, particularly the EU, the US, and Russia.
- **Resource markets**: Ukraine's development will impact global food and energy markets, contributing to greater resource security.

## Conclusion

Ukraine's role during the Second Thirty Years War highlights the importance of resource-rich UDPs in navigating the turmoil phase. While challenges remain, Ukraine's favourable characteristics and strategic importance position it as a key player in the MDTC framework.

The SADAT is required for development, especially during moderns. If there is enough of it (e.g. America is discovered), the people start to actively (and aggressively) explore it. If there is not enough SADAT, the people start to fight each other for the available SADAT (e.g. World War II - Juri Gagarin didn't discover the new "America" in SADAT).

The discoveries of new SADAT ease the wars and give the energy a way to exit the system and be applied to the development of the new SADAT.

Each modern seem to be have the information revolution closer to the end. The information revolution is a period of rapid technological and social change caused by the introduction of new information technologies.

The theory assumes a non-linear progression of "modern," "turmoil," and "stable development," which may have overlapping or cyclical patterns and depend on the place where the params are measured (like a water flow), but for the sake of simplicity, the theory is presented in a semi-linear "single-wave" format.

The moderns are period of development that is similar to laminar flow in water and gases, and the turmoils are similar to turbulent flow.

# Favourable countries

During the turmoil, countries "fall to their resource basis"—globalization ends, regionalization begins, and old power centers lose access to distant resources. The base of power shifts to renewable resources and local self-sufficiency.

The countries that have a high ratio of local key resources (food, energy, key production) to their population are called "favourable countries." These countries are better positioned to maintain stability and preserve societal structures during the turmoil.

## Characteristics of favourable countries:

- **Abundance of renewable resources**: Access to water, arable land, and renewable energy sources.
- **Low population density**: Ensures that resources are sufficient to meet the needs of the population.
- **Geographical advantages**: Natural barriers or isolation that protect against external conflicts.
- **Self-sufficiency**: Ability to produce essential goods locally, reducing dependence on imports.

The concept of "favourable countries" applies only during the turmoil period. In the modern period, success depends more on the consolidation of power, technological development, and production scale.

## Measuring Country Favourability

Country favourability can be measured using the following criteria:

1. **Resource-to-Population Ratio**:

   - Calculate the availability of key resources (e.g., food, energy, water) per capita.
   - Higher ratios indicate better favourability.

2. **Renewable Resource Availability**:

   - Assess the abundance of renewable resources such as arable land, freshwater, and renewable energy sources.
   - Countries with higher renewable resource availability score better.

3. **Population Density**:

   - Evaluate the population density relative to resource availability.
   - Lower population density with sufficient resources indicates higher favourability.

4. **Self-Sufficiency Index**:
   - Measure the ability to produce essential goods locally, reducing dependence on imports.
   - Higher self-sufficiency scores improve favourability.

By combining these factors into a composite index, countries can be ranked based on their ability to maintain stability and development during turmoil periods.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the list of favourable countries and areas is:

- Ukraine
- Canada
- Kazakhstan
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Azerbaijan
- Botswana?
- Guyana
- Galifaks
- Costa Rica
- Mongolia?
- Panama
- Scandinavia
- Uruguay

The countries of average favourability are:

- Israel
- USA

The non-favourable countries are:

- Russia
- China
- India
- Turkey
- France
- Germany

### Types of non-favourability:

1. **"Wild west"**: Too much territory, not enough people (e.g., Russia, Canada in some regions).
2. **"Harsh east"**: Too many people, not enough territory or resources (e.g., China, India).

## Outcomes for non-favourable countries:

Non-favourable countries are likely to experience fragmentation. Favourable regions within these countries may separate to form new societies or states. On favourable territories, the following are more likely to be preserved:

- Free market
- Civil rights
- Democracy
- Freedom of speech
- Emancipation

## Implications:

The turmoil period highlights the importance of local resource availability and self-sufficiency. Favourable countries are better equipped to navigate the challenges of this phase, while non-favourable countries face significant risks of collapse and reorganization.

# Key technologies

Key technologies are the technologies that radically increase the efficiency of labor. They achieve this by enabling the manipulation of energy and unlocking new resources or making existing resources more accessible.

Examples of key technologies:

- Steel axe: Enabled large-scale deforestation and agriculture.
- Steam engine: Revolutionized transportation and industry.
- Electricity: Provided a versatile and efficient energy source.
- Internal combustion engine: Powered vehicles and machinery.
- Tractor: Mechanized agriculture, drastically increasing productivity.

Examples of non-key technologies:

- Airplane: Revolutionized travel but depends on key technologies like the internal combustion engine.
- Computer: Enhanced information processing but relies on electricity and other key technologies.
- Information technologies (e.g., internet, printing press): Indirectly increase labor efficiency but are built on key technologies.

The distinction is that non-key technologies, while transformative, are dependent on key technologies. Without the foundational energy and resource manipulation enabled by key technologies, non-key technologies cannot function.
@@@ ./mdtc/mdtc.md
This section describes the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC) and its key concepts.

[Basic cycle of technological civilization](cycle.md)

The MDTC theory posits that the development of civilizations follows a cyclical pattern driven by the interaction between technological progress, resource availability, and social structures. The three main phases of this cycle are Modern, Turmoil, and Stable Development.

- **Modern**: A period of rapid technological and social change, characterized by the consolidation of power and the exploitation of non-renewable resources to accelerate development.
- **Turmoil**: A transitional phase marked by instability, as societies struggle to adapt to the depletion of non-renewable resources, absense of SADAT for getting new resources, and the limitations of existing technologies.
- **Stable Development**: A phase of relative equilibrium, where societies rely on renewable resources and maintain slower, more sustainable progress.

The theory emphasizes the importance of "SADAT" (resources available for development with current technology) and "key technologies" (those that significantly increase labor efficiency) in shaping the trajectory of civilizations.

@@@ ./mdtc/migration.md
# Migration

Migration plays a critical role in the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC), particularly during the turmoil and modern periods. It serves as both a response to resource scarcity and a mechanism for redistributing labor and resources.

## Migration during Modern periods

In modern periods, migration is often driven by the rapid expansion of industrial centers and the need for labor. Key characteristics include:

- **Urbanization**: People move from rural areas to cities to work in industries powered by [key technologies](key-tech.md).
- **Colonization**: Migration to newly discovered or underdeveloped SADAT (e.g., the Americas during the Age of Discovery) to exploit resources and expand economic activity.
- **Forced migration**: In some cases, groups are displaced or relocated to facilitate modernization efforts (e.g., the transatlantic slave trade, forced collectivization in the USSR).

Migration during modern periods often accelerates development by concentrating labor and resources in areas of high productivity.

## Migration during Turmoil periods

In turmoil periods, migration is typically a response to instability, resource scarcity, and conflict. Key characteristics include:

- **Refugee movements**: Large-scale displacement of populations due to war, famine, or political collapse.
- **Internal migration**: Movement within countries as people seek more favorable regions (e.g., areas with better access to resources or less conflict).
- **Brain drain**: Skilled workers and intellectuals migrate to more stable regions, exacerbating challenges in their home countries.

Migration during turmoil periods can lead to significant demographic shifts, with some regions becoming depopulated while others experience overpopulation and strain on resources.

## Migration and Favourable Countries

Favourable countries often become destinations for migrants during turmoil periods due to their relative stability and resource abundance. This influx of migrants can:

- Provide a labor force to develop underutilized resources.
- Introduce cultural and technological innovations.
- Create social and political challenges, such as integration and resource allocation.

## Historical Examples

- **European migration to the Americas**: During the Age of Discovery, migration to the Americas provided new SADAT for development and alleviated resource pressures in Europe.
- **Post-World War II migration**: Displaced populations in Europe relocated to more stable regions, contributing to reconstruction and economic growth.
- **Current turmoil (2020–2050)**: Migration from non-favourable countries (e.g., parts of Africa, the Middle East) to favourable countries (e.g., Canada, Scandinavia) is expected to increase as resource scarcity and instability worsen.

## Implications

Migration is both a symptom and a driver of the cycles described in the MDTC theory. While it can alleviate pressures in some regions, it can also create new challenges in others. Understanding migration patterns is essential for predicting the outcomes of turmoil and modern periods.

# Modern

Modern - a period of rapid technological and social change.
It's called "Time of changes" in Chinese philosophy, "periods of great passionarity" in the theory of passionarity by Lev Gumilev, and period of "assabiyah" in the theory of Ibn Khaldun.

Each modern is characterized by consolidation of power being the best way for domination.
Consolidation lead to globalization, and the power centers benefit from it.

The question of each modern - who will be sacrificed to get the resources for the modernization (rebuilding the world around new [ket technologies](key-tech.md)).

- Jews in the Nazi Germany
- Peasants in the USSR
- Church in England under Henry VIII
  - Henry VIII is like Stalin

There is a concept of "second-wave modern" - e.g. the stuff that happened to some countries in the 20th century (Iran, Asian tigers)
@@@ ./mdtc/space.md
# Space Available for Development with Available Technology (SADAT)

Space Available for Development with Available Technology (SADAT) is defined as the physical area and resources available for development with current technology. It includes both renewable resources (e.g., sunlight, water) and non-renewable resources (e.g., minerals, fossil fuels).

Inventing a [key technology](key-tech.md) is a way to increase the amount of SADAT. Key technologies unlock new resources or make existing resources more accessible and efficient to use.

E.g. when the iron axe was invented, the amount of SADAT increased significantly by clearing forests for agriculture and using the wood for construction and fuel. Similarly, the steam engine expanded SADAT by enabling the extraction of coal and the development of railways.

Or when shipbuilding technology improved, the amount of SADAT increased by allowing for the transportation of goods and people over long distances, opening up new trade routes and markets. This led to the establishment of colonies and the exploitation of resources in distant lands, further increasing SADAT.
@@@ ./mdtc/stable.md
# Stable Development

Stable Development is the final phase in the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC). It is characterized by a period of relative equilibrium, where societies rely on renewable resources and maintain slower, more sustainable progress.

Key features of the Stable Development phase:

- **Renewable resource reliance**: Societies transition to using renewable resources as the primary basis for their economies.
- **Decentralized stability**: Governance structures become more localized, with a focus on maintaining balance rather than rapid expansion.
- **Gradual technological progress**: Innovations occur at a slower pace, focusing on optimizing existing technologies rather than creating new key technologies.
- **Social cohesion**: Societies prioritize stability, equality, and long-term planning over short-term gains.

Stable Development represents a sustainable model of civilization, but it is also vulnerable to external shocks or the emergence of new Modern periods that disrupt the equilibrium.
@@@ ./mdtc/turmoil.md
# Turmoil

Turmoil or "смута" is a period after the modern. The turmoil happens because the old sources of non-renewable resources that were used for fast modernization and consolidation of power are depleted, if the science progress is slowed down (because most of the tech of the current уклад is already invented) and the new sources of non-renewable resources are not discovered yet.

It seems that usually the turmoil takes around 30 years (two generations) to resolve.

The harshness of the turmoil depends of the amount of space left. If there is not much - it's horrible war of everyone against everyone.

Usually there are some space left in forms of "неудобий" (uncomfortable to develop places, UDP) that were not used much for development during the moderns because of some stopping factors.

Then the turmoil is happening along the "распашка неудобий" (development of UDP) - people actively trying to finally develop the UDP despite the stopping factors by overcoming them.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the key UDPs are:

- Ukraine
- Russia
- Belarus
- Kazakhstan

# Favourable countries

During the turmoil, countries "fall to their resource basis"—globalization ends, regionalization begins, and old power centers lose access to distant resources. The base of power shifts to renewable resources and local self-sufficiency.

The countries that have a high ratio of local key resources (food, energy, key production) to their population are called "favourable countries." These countries are better positioned to maintain stability and preserve societal structures during the turmoil.

## Characteristics of favourable countries:

- **Abundance of renewable resources**: Access to water, arable land, and renewable energy sources.
- **Low population density**: Ensures that resources are sufficient to meet the needs of the population.
- **Geographical advantages**: Natural barriers or isolation that protect against external conflicts.
- **Self-sufficiency**: Ability to produce essential goods locally, reducing dependence on imports.

The concept of "favourable countries" applies only during the turmoil period. In the modern period, success depends more on the consolidation of power, technological development, and production scale.

## Measuring Country Favourability

Country favourability can be measured using the following criteria:

1. **Resource-to-Population Ratio**:

   - Calculate the availability of key resources (e.g., food, energy, water) per capita.
   - Higher ratios indicate better favourability.

2. **Renewable Resource Availability**:

   - Assess the abundance of renewable resources such as arable land, freshwater, and renewable energy sources.
   - Countries with higher renewable resource availability score better.

3. **Population Density**:

   - Evaluate the population density relative to resource availability.
   - Lower population density with sufficient resources indicates higher favourability.

4. **Self-Sufficiency Index**:
   - Measure the ability to produce essential goods locally, reducing dependence on imports.
   - Higher self-sufficiency scores improve favourability.

By combining these factors into a composite index, countries can be ranked based on their ability to maintain stability and development during turmoil periods.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the list of favourable countries and areas is:

- Ukraine
- Canada
- Kazakhstan
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Azerbaijan
- Botswana?
- Guyana
- Galifaks
- Costa Rica
- Mongolia?
- Panama
- Scandinavia
- Uruguay

The countries of average favourability are:

- Israel
- USA

The non-favourable countries are:

- Russia
- China
- India
- Turkey
- France
- Germany

### Types of non-favourability:

1. **"Wild west"**: Too much territory, not enough people (e.g., Russia, Canada in some regions).
2. **"Harsh east"**: Too many people, not enough territory or resources (e.g., China, India).

## Outcomes for non-favourable countries:

Non-favourable countries are likely to experience fragmentation. Favourable regions within these countries may separate to form new societies or states. On favourable territories, the following are more likely to be preserved:

- Free market
- Civil rights
- Democracy
- Freedom of speech
- Emancipation

## Implications:

The turmoil period highlights the importance of local resource availability and self-sufficiency. Favourable countries are better equipped to navigate the challenges of this phase, while non-favourable countries face significant risks of collapse and reorganization.

# Key technologies

Key technologies are the technologies that radically increase the efficiency of labor. They achieve this by enabling the manipulation of energy and unlocking new resources or making existing resources more accessible.

Examples of key technologies:

- Steel axe: Enabled large-scale deforestation and agriculture.
- Steam engine: Revolutionized transportation and industry.
- Electricity: Provided a versatile and efficient energy source.
- Internal combustion engine: Powered vehicles and machinery.
- Tractor: Mechanized agriculture, drastically increasing productivity.

Examples of non-key technologies:

- Airplane: Revolutionized travel but depends on key technologies like the internal combustion engine.
- Computer: Enhanced information processing but relies on electricity and other key technologies.
- Information technologies (e.g., internet, printing press): Indirectly increase labor efficiency but are built on key technologies.

The distinction is that non-key technologies, while transformative, are dependent on key technologies. Without the foundational energy and resource manipulation enabled by key technologies, non-key technologies cannot function.

This section describes the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC) and its key concepts.

[Basic cycle of technological civilization](cycle.md)

The MDTC theory posits that the development of civilizations follows a cyclical pattern driven by the interaction between technological progress, resource availability, and social structures. The three main phases of this cycle are Modern, Turmoil, and Stable Development.

- **Modern**: A period of rapid technological and social change, characterized by the consolidation of power and the exploitation of non-renewable resources to accelerate development.
- **Turmoil**: A transitional phase marked by instability, as societies struggle to adapt to the depletion of non-renewable resources, absense of SADAT for getting new resources, and the limitations of existing technologies.
- **Stable Development**: A phase of relative equilibrium, where societies rely on renewable resources and maintain slower, more sustainable progress.

The theory emphasizes the importance of "SADAT" (resources available for development with current technology) and "key technologies" (those that significantly increase labor efficiency) in shaping the trajectory of civilizations.

# Migration

Migration plays a critical role in the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC), particularly during the turmoil and modern periods. It serves as both a response to resource scarcity and a mechanism for redistributing labor and resources.

## Migration during Modern periods

In modern periods, migration is often driven by the rapid expansion of industrial centers and the need for labor. Key characteristics include:

- **Urbanization**: People move from rural areas to cities to work in industries powered by [key technologies](key-tech.md).
- **Colonization**: Migration to newly discovered or underdeveloped SADAT (e.g., the Americas during the Age of Discovery) to exploit resources and expand economic activity.
- **Forced migration**: In some cases, groups are displaced or relocated to facilitate modernization efforts (e.g., the transatlantic slave trade, forced collectivization in the USSR).

Migration during modern periods often accelerates development by concentrating labor and resources in areas of high productivity.

## Migration during Turmoil periods

In turmoil periods, migration is typically a response to instability, resource scarcity, and conflict. Key characteristics include:

- **Refugee movements**: Large-scale displacement of populations due to war, famine, or political collapse.
- **Internal migration**: Movement within countries as people seek more favorable regions (e.g., areas with better access to resources or less conflict).
- **Brain drain**: Skilled workers and intellectuals migrate to more stable regions, exacerbating challenges in their home countries.

Migration during turmoil periods can lead to significant demographic shifts, with some regions becoming depopulated while others experience overpopulation and strain on resources.

## Migration and Favourable Countries

Favourable countries often become destinations for migrants during turmoil periods due to their relative stability and resource abundance. This influx of migrants can:

- Provide a labor force to develop underutilized resources.
- Introduce cultural and technological innovations.
- Create social and political challenges, such as integration and resource allocation.

## Historical Examples

- **European migration to the Americas**: During the Age of Discovery, migration to the Americas provided new SADAT for development and alleviated resource pressures in Europe.
- **Post-World War II migration**: Displaced populations in Europe relocated to more stable regions, contributing to reconstruction and economic growth.
- **Current turmoil (2020–2050)**: Migration from non-favourable countries (e.g., parts of Africa, the Middle East) to favourable countries (e.g., Canada, Scandinavia) is expected to increase as resource scarcity and instability worsen.

## Implications

Migration is both a symptom and a driver of the cycles described in the MDTC theory. While it can alleviate pressures in some regions, it can also create new challenges in others. Understanding migration patterns is essential for predicting the outcomes of turmoil and modern periods.

# Modern

Modern - a period of rapid technological and social change.
It's called "Time of changes" in Chinese philosophy, "periods of great passionarity" in the theory of passionarity by Lev Gumilev, and period of "assabiyah" in the theory of Ibn Khaldun.

Each modern is characterized by consolidation of power being the best way for domination.
Consolidation lead to globalization, and the power centers benefit from it.

The question of each modern - who will be sacrificed to get the resources for the modernization (rebuilding the world around new [ket technologies](key-tech.md)).

- Jews in the Nazi Germany
- Peasants in the USSR
- Church in England under Henry VIII
  - Henry VIII is like Stalin

There is a concept of "second-wave modern" - e.g. the stuff that happened to some countries in the 20th century (Iran, Asian tigers)
@@@ ./mdtc/space.md

# Space

Space is defined as the physical area and resources available for development with current technology. It includes both renewable resources (e.g., sunlight, water) and non-renewable resources (e.g., minerals, fossil fuels).

Inventing a [key technology](key-tech.md) is a way to increase the amount of SADAT. Key technologies unlock new resources or make existing resources more accessible and efficient to use.

E.g. when the iron axe was invented, the amount of SADAT increased significantly by clearing forests for agriculture and using the wood for construction and fuel. Similarly, the steam engine expanded SADAT by enabling the extraction of coal and the development of railways.
@@@ ./mdtc/stable.md

# Stable Development

Stable Development is the final phase in the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC). It is characterized by a period of relative equilibrium, where societies rely on renewable resources and maintain slower, more sustainable progress.

Key features of the Stable Development phase:

- **Renewable resource reliance**: Societies transition to using renewable resources as the primary basis for their economies.
- **Decentralized stability**: Governance structures become more localized, with a focus on maintaining balance rather than rapid expansion.
- **Gradual technological progress**: Innovations occur at a slower pace, focusing on optimizing existing technologies rather than creating new key technologies.
- **Social cohesion**: Societies prioritize stability, equality, and long-term planning over short-term gains.

Stable Development represents a sustainable model of civilization, but it is also vulnerable to external shocks or the emergence of new Modern periods that disrupt the equilibrium.
@@@ ./mdtc/turmoil.md

# Turmoil

Turmoil or "смута" is a period after the modern. The turmoil happens because the old sources of non-renewable resources that were used for fast modernization and consolidation of power are depleted, if the science progress is slowed down (because most of the tech of the current уклад is already invented) and the new sources of non-renewable resources are not discovered yet.

It seems that usually the turmoil takes around 30 years (two generations) to resolve.

The harshness of the turmoil depends of the amount of space left. If there is not much - it's horrible war of everyone against everyone.

Usually there are some space left in forms of "неудобий" (uncomfortable to develop places, UDP) that were not used much for development during the moderns because of some stopping factors.

Then the turmoil is happening along the "распашка неудобий" (development of UDP) - people actively trying to finally develop the UDP despite the stopping factors by overcoming them.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the key UDPs are:

- Ukraine
- Russia
- Belarus
- Kazakhstan

# Netherlands during the First Thirty Years War

The Netherlands' trajectory during the First Thirty Years War illustrates the potential for innovation and economic transformation during turmoil periods in the MDTC framework.

## Context

- **Independence struggle**: The Netherlands was engaged in the Eighty Years' War (1568–1648) against Spain, seeking independence.
- **Economic transformation**: The Dutch Republic became a global trading and financial hub, leveraging its maritime and commercial expertise.
- **Key technologies**: The Dutch excelled in shipbuilding, navigation, and financial innovations, enabling them to dominate global trade.

## Analysis in MDTC Terms

The Netherlands can be considered a UDP after the Age of Discovery (1400s–1600s), as its marshy terrain and lack of natural resources initially posed significant challenges to development. However, these constraints were overcome through technological and economic innovation.

### Migration

- The Netherlands became a destination for skilled migrants, including religious refugees (e.g., Huguenots from France) who contributed to its economic and technological development.
  - This migration occurred primarily in the late 1500s and early 1600s, particularly after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572) and during the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598).
- Internal migration from rural areas to urban centers like Amsterdam fueled the growth of trade and industry.
  - This trend accelerated during the late 1500s and early 1600s as cities became hubs of commerce and innovation.

### Key Technologies in terms of MDTC

- **Water power**: The Dutch utilized windmills and advanced water management systems to reclaim land and support agriculture.
  - These innovations were developed and widely implemented during the 1500s and 1600s, particularly as part of the Dutch Golden Age (1580s–1670s).
- **Shipbuilding**: The Dutch became leaders in shipbuilding technology, creating more space fot them

### Key Resources

- **Food**: The Netherlands imported grain from the Baltic region, ensuring food security despite limited arable land.
  - This trade was most prominent during the 1500s and 1600s, facilitated by the Dutch dominance in maritime trade.
- **Energy**: Peat was a critical energy resource, used for heating and industrial processes.
  - Peat extraction and usage were significant from the late 1500s onward.

### Population Density

- The Netherlands had one of the highest population densities in Europe, which necessitated efficient land use and resource management.
  - By the early 1600s, during the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), the Netherlands had a population density of approximately 50–60 people per square kilometer, one of the highest in Europe.
- Urbanization and trade networks helped mitigate the pressures of high population density by creating economic opportunities.
  - _Where they migrated?_: Migration primarily occurred from rural areas to urban centers such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Leiden, which became economic and cultural hubs during this period.
    @@@ mdtc/2-30-w/ukraine.md

# Ukraine in the MDTC Framework

Ukraine holds a unique position in the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC) due to its resource abundance, geographical location, and historical context. As a key UDP (uncomfortable to develop place) during the current turmoil (2020–2050), Ukraine is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the outcomes of this phase.

## Current Context

- **Resource abundance**: Ukraine has fertile agricultural land, significant energy resources, and a strategic location as a transit hub between Europe and Asia.
- **Geopolitical significance**: Ukraine's position makes it a focal point of competition between global powers, particularly the West and Russia.
- **Challenges**: Political instability, corruption, and the ongoing conflict with Russia have hindered Ukraine's ability to fully capitalize on its resources.

## Role During the Second Thirty Years War (2020–2050)

### Key Factors:

1. **Development of UDP**: Ukraine is one of the key UDPs being actively developed during the turmoil. Overcoming historical and structural challenges will be critical to unlocking its potential.
2. **Favourable country characteristics**: Ukraine's resource-to-population ratio positions it as a favourable country, capable of maintaining stability and fostering development during the turmoil.
3. **Migration dynamics**: Ukraine may experience both emigration (due to conflict and economic challenges) and immigration (as a destination for displaced populations from less favourable regions).

### Forecast:

- **Short-term (2020–2030)**:

  - Continued conflict with Russia will dominate the geopolitical landscape.
  - Efforts to integrate with European markets and institutions will accelerate, providing access to capital and technology.
  - Agricultural and energy sectors will see significant investment, driven by global demand for food and energy security.

- **Mid-term (2030–2040)**:

  - Ukraine will emerge as a regional power, leveraging its resources and strategic location.
  - Decentralization and local governance reforms will strengthen internal stability.
  - Migration patterns will stabilize, with Ukraine becoming a destination for skilled workers and refugees from less favourable regions.

- **Long-term (2040–2050)**:
  - Ukraine will transition into a key player in the global renewable energy market, capitalizing on its natural resources and technological advancements.
  - The country will serve as a model for successful UDP development, demonstrating the potential for transformation during turmoil periods.
  - By the end of the Second Thirty Years War, Ukraine will be well-positioned to enter the Stable Development phase, with a diversified economy and strong social cohesion.

## Implications for the Region

Ukraine's trajectory will have significant implications for the broader region:

- **Eastern Europe**: Ukraine's success could inspire similar transformations in neighboring countries, fostering regional stability.
- **Global powers**: The competition for influence in Ukraine will shape the strategies of global powers, particularly the EU, the US, and Russia.
- **Resource markets**: Ukraine's development will impact global food and energy markets, contributing to greater resource security.

## Conclusion

Ukraine's role during the Second Thirty Years War highlights the importance of resource-rich UDPs in navigating the turmoil phase. While challenges remain, Ukraine's favourable characteristics and strategic importance position it as a key player in the MDTC framework.

# Basic cycle of technological civilization

1. [Modern](modern.md) - a period of rapid technological and social change
2. [Turmoil](turmoil.md) - a period of social and political instability
3. [Stable development](stable.md) - a period of relative stability and gradual change

| Period             | Priority of Resources                                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modern             | Non-renewable resources                                          |
| Turmoil            | Mixed (caused by the transition from non-renewable to renewable) |
| Stable development | Renewable resources                                              |

Non-renewable give a temporary much greater speed of development because in unlocks the temporary boost the science progress in [key technologies](key-tech.md).

The space is required for development, expecially during moderns. If there is enough of it (e.g. America is discovered), the people start to actively (and aggressively) explore it. If there is not enough space, the people start to fight each other for the available space (e.g. World War II - Juri Gagarin didn't discover the new "America" in space).

The discoveries of new spaces ease the wars and give the energy a way to exit the system and be applied to the development of the new spaces.

Each modern seem to be have the information revolution closer to the end. The information revolution is a period of rapid technological and social change caused by the introduction of new information technologies.

The theory assumes a non-linear progression of "modern," "turmoil," and "stable development," which may have overlapping or cyclical patterns and depend on the place where the params are measured (like a water flow), but for the sake of simplicity, the theory is presented in a semi-linear "single-wave" format.

The moderns are period of development that is similar to laminar flow in water and gases, and the turmoils are similar to turbulent flow.

It seems that usually the turmoil takes around 30 years (two generations) to resolve.

The harshness of the turmoil depends of the amount of space left. If there is not much - it's horrible war of everyone against everyone.

Usually there are some space left in forms of "неудобий" (uncomfortable to develop places, UDP) that were not used much for development during the moderns because of some stopping factors.

Then the turmoil is happening along the "распашка неудобий" (development of UDP) - people actively trying to finally develop the UDP despite the stopping factors by overcoming them.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the key UDPs are:

- Ukraine
- Russia
- Belarus
- Kazakhstan
