That's an intriguing idea. If we assume there's a **"Model of Development of Technological Civilization" (MDTC)**, we'd be looking for a general principle or framework that governs how civilizations evolve technologically over time—possibly with predictable stages, patterns, or thresholds.

Such a model might include elements like:

**Energy Utilization** (e.g., Kardashev scale – Type I, II, III civilizations based on energy harnessed).

**Information Processing** (e.g., development of writing, printing, computing, AI).

**Complex Systems Emergence** (e.g., economic systems, governance, internet).

**Accelerating Returns** (e.g., exponential growth in tech innovation, à la Kurzweil).

**Crisis and Transformation Cycles** (e.g., resource depletion, climate tipping points, global wars).

**Limits and Plateaus** (e.g., ecological limits, social saturation of innovation).

To make this a useful model, we'd have to define:

**Stages** (primitive, agricultural, industrial, digital, post-digital?)

**Forces** (technological, social, ecological, psychological?)

**Feedback Loops** (does technological advancement cause social change, which in turn affects tech development?)

**Constraints** (physical, cultural, informational?)

Would you like to build this model as a formal framework, perhaps as a set of stages, laws, or predictions?
