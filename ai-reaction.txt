Counterargument:

Russia and China, despite being labeled "non-favourable," have demonstrated resilience and adaptability in leveraging their vast resources and centralized governance to maintain global influence

Answer:

Well that happened not during the turmoil in terms of MDTC but modern periods.

Elaboration:

However, one could argue that their centralized governance models allow them to mitigate the effects of turmoil better than decentralized systems. For example, China's ability to rapidly mobilize resources during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates a form of adaptability that challenges the "non-favourable" label.

Answer:

The very nature of turmoil is about the disruption of centralized systems, because of the edge points having will/power to go on it's own better then together (without the need to give a share to the center)

# 2

Counterargument:

Historical counter-example: Post-World War II Japan lacked many natural resources but became an economic powerhouse through innovation and industrial policy.

Answer:

It was not during the turmoil period but during the modern period.

Elaboration:

Additionally, Japan's success highlights the role of human capital and strategic alliances (e.g., U.S. support during the Cold War) in overcoming resource limitations, which the theory might underemphasize.

Answer:

Hey, it was not during the turmoil period but during the modern period. Check the dates, this discussion doesn't make sense.

# 3

Counterargument:

- The airplane, labeled as "non-key," revolutionized global trade, travel, and warfare, indirectly boosting labor efficiency.
- The internet, also considered "non-key," has transformed economies by enabling remote work, e-commerce, and global communication.

Answer:

The non-key technologies are dependent and limited by key technologies.

Elaboration:

While this is true, the transformative impact of non-key technologies like the internet suggests that their role in shaping societies might be more significant than the theory accounts for. For instance, the internet has created entirely new industries and economic models, which could challenge the strict categorization of "key" vs. "non-key."

Answer:

The distinction is simple - internet is definitely important, but it's derived from the key technologies - no power = no internet, but not vice versa.

# 4

Counterargument:

**On the impact of space on development:**
   - The idea that "space" (physical or metaphorical) is a prerequisite for development overlooks the role of innovation in overcoming spatial limitations. For example:
     - The Green Revolution significantly increased agricultural productivity without requiring new physical space.
     - Urbanization and vertical farming address space constraints in densely populated areas.

Answer:

The space here is a term that indicates not only the actual space, but also resources that are available in the area, both renewable (sun, water) and non-renewable (minerals, oil). So the ideas above doesn't contradict the theory?

Elaboration:

However, the examples provided (e.g., Green Revolution, vertical farming) suggest that innovation can redefine what constitutes "space" and resource availability, potentially reducing the importance of physical or geographical constraints in development.

Answer:

Important note - the space in MDTC is actually "the area that contains the resources available for development with the current technology". So new technology = better current technology = more "space". That's the essense of the modern - to consolidate power to speed up the development of the new technology to constantly get more space and then consolidate more power. But when the development of the new technologies stops, the physical space with semi-constant technologies runs out faster and are not able to fuels the consolidation-based system aimed for fast growth.

# 5

Counterargument:

**On the inevitability of turmoil:**
   - The theory suggests that turmoil is an unavoidable phase, but some societies have managed to avoid large-scale instability during transitions. For example:
     - Scandinavian countries transitioned to modern welfare states with minimal turmoil compared to other regions.
     - Singapore's rapid modernization avoided significant social or political instability.

Answer:

All that happened during the modern period. Turmoil in the MDTC is not any turmoil, but a specific turmoil that is related to the transition from modern to stable development.

Elaboration:

It could also be argued that the Scandinavian model and Singapore's governance demonstrate that deliberate policy choices and social cohesion can mitigate or even bypass the severity of turmoil, challenging the inevitability of this phase.

Answer:

Again, there wasn't the Turmoil in terms of MDTC during the period that you mentioned. Check the dates.

# 6

Counterargument:

**On the sacrifices during modernization:**

   - The assertion that modernization always requires sacrifices (e.g., Jews in Nazi Germany, peasants in the USSR) risks conflating specific historical atrocities with broader development trends. For example:
     - Post-war Germany and Japan modernized rapidly without comparable sacrifices, focusing instead on rebuilding and democratization.

Answer:

Well yes, they made the required sacrifices during and before the war.

Elaboration:

This raises the question of whether the sacrifices attributed to modernization are a prerequisite or a consequence of specific political and social contexts. For instance, could modernization occur without such sacrifices in a more equitable system?
