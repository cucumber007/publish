# Space

Space is defined as the physical area that contains resources that are available for development in with current technology.

Inventing a [key technology](key-tech.md) is a way to increase the amount of space available for development.

E.g. when iron axe was invented, the amount of space available for development increased significantly by clearing the forests for agriculture and using the wood for construction and fuel.
