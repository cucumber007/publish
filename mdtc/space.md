# Space

Space is defined as the physical area and resources available for development with current technology. It includes both renewable resources (e.g., sunlight, water) and non-renewable resources (e.g., minerals, fossil fuels).

Inventing a [key technology](key-tech.md) is a way to increase the amount of space available for development. Key technologies unlock new resources or make existing resources more accessible and efficient to use.

E.g. when the iron axe was invented, the amount of space available for development increased significantly by clearing forests for agriculture and using the wood for construction and fuel. Similarly, the steam engine expanded space by enabling the extraction of coal and the development of railways.
