# Turmoil

Turmoil or "смута" is a period after the modern. The turmoil happens because the old sources of non-renewable resources that were used for fast modernization and consolidation of power are depleted, if the science progress is slowed down (because most of the tech of the current уклад is already invented) and the new sources of non-renewable resources are not discovered yet.

It seems that usually the turmoil takes around 30 years (two generations) to resolve.

The harshness of the turmoil depends of the amount of space left. If there is not much - it's horrible war of everyone against everyone.

Usually there are some space left in forms of "неудобий" (uncomfortable to develop places, UDP) that were not used much for development during the moderns because of some stopping factors.

Then the turmoil is happening along the "распашка неудобий" (development of UDP) - people actively trying to finally develop the UDP despite the stopping factors by overcoming them.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the key UDPs are:

- Ukraine
- Russia
- Belarus
- Kazakhstan
