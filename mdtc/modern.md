# Modern

Modern - a period of rapid technological and social change.
It's called "Time of changes" in Chinese philosophy, "periods of great passionarity" in the theory of passionarity by Lev Gumilev, and period of "assabiyah" in the theory of Ibn Khaldun. 

Each modern is characterized by consolidation of power being the best way for domination.
Consolidation lead to globalization, and the power centers benefit from it.

The question of each modern - who will be sacrificed to get the resources for the modernization (rebuilding the world around new [ket technologies](key-tech.md)).
- Jews in the Nazi Germany
- Peasants in the USSR
- Church in England under Henry VIII
  - Henry VIII is like Stalin
