# Favourable countries

During the turmoil the countries are "fall to it's resource basis" - the globalization ends, regionalization starts, and the old power centers are not able to get their resources from the far away places anymore.

The base of the power shift to renewable resources.

The countries that have a lot of local key resources (food, energy, key production) compared to it's population are called "favourable countries".

The concept of "favourable countries" is appliend only for the turmoil period. During the modern the success is more dependent on the consolidation of power that lead to faster technological development and scale of the production.

In the current turmoil (2020-2050) the list of favourable countries is:
- Ukraine
- Canada
- Kazakhstan
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Azerbaijan
- Botswana?
- Guyana
- Galifaks
- Costa Rica
- Mongolia?
- Panama
- Scandinavia
- Uruguay

The countries of average favourability are:
- Israel
- USA 

The non-favourable countries are:
- Russia
- China
- India
- Turkey
- France
- Germany

The non-favourable countries will probably fall apart and a non-favourable societies will form on the territories that are non-favourable, dependent of the type of the non-favourability.

The types of the un-favourability:
- "Wild west" - too much territory, not enough people
- "Harsh east" - too much people, not enough territory

The favourable part will probably separate to form new countries/societies.

Only on favourable territories those items will preserve:
- Free market
- Civil rights
- Democracy
- Freedom of speech
- Emancipation
