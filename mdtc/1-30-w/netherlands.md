## UDP

The Netherlands can be considered a UDP after the Age of Discovery (1400s–1600s), as its marshy terrain and lack of natural resources initially posed significant challenges to development.

## SADAT Timeline

SADAT changes occured mostly when new territories were became accessible to Dutch as a colony or a new technology got developed.

Include the changes in colonies and technologies that increased SADAT.

### Migration

- The Netherlands became a destination for skilled migrants, including religious refugees (e.g., Huguenots from France) who contributed to its economic and technological development.
  - This migration occurred primarily in the late 1500s and early 1600s, particularly after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572) and during the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598).
- Internal migration from rural areas to urban centers like Amsterdam fueled the growth of trade and industry.
  - This trend accelerated during the late 1500s and early 1600s as cities became hubs of commerce and innovation.

### Key Technologies in terms of MDTC

- **Water power**: The Dutch utilized windmills and advanced water management systems to reclaim land and support agriculture.
  - These innovations were developed and widely implemented during the 1500s and 1600s, particularly as part of the Dutch Golden Age (1580s–1670s).
- **Shipbuilding**: The Dutch became leaders in shipbuilding technology, creating more SADAT for them.

### Key Resources

- **Food**: The Netherlands imported grain from the Baltic region, ensuring food security despite limited arable land.
  - This trade was most prominent during the 1500s and 1600s, facilitated by the Dutch dominance in maritime trade.
- **Energy**: Peat was a critical energy resource, used for heating and industrial processes.
  - Peat extraction and usage were significant from the late 1500s onward.

### Population Density

- The Netherlands had one of the highest population densities in Europe, which necessitated efficient land use and resource management.
  - By the early 1600s, during the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), the Netherlands had a population density of approximately 50–60 people per square kilometer, one of the highest in Europe.
- Urbanization and trade networks helped mitigate the pressures of high population density by creating economic opportunities.
  - _Where they migrated?_: Migration primarily occurred from rural areas to urban centers such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Leiden, which became economic and cultural hubs during this period.
