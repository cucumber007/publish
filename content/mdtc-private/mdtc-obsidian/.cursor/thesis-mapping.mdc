## Thesis mapping

This vault maps ideas by turning claims in texts into linkable thesis nodes, backed by concept nodes.

### Folder roles

- `1_texts/`: longform notes / drafts / raw thinking. This is where claims are written in natural language.
- `3_thesises/`: atomic (or close to atomic) thesis notes—canonical “nodes” that can be linked from many texts.
- `2_concepts/`: reusable conceptual structures (definitions, taxonomies, chains, mechanisms) that theses and texts reference.

### Mapping mechanism

Inline Obsidian links are the mapping: when a sentence contains a claim, it links to the relevant thesis/concept note.

Link format: `[[Canonical thesis title|wording that fits the sentence]]` so the text reads well while still mapping to the node.

Texts link TO theses/concepts at the moment the claim is made.

Theses link BACK to the supporting text(s) so the thesis node can be audited and expanded later.

Adding links should keep text the same (see `wording that fits the sentence` part).
