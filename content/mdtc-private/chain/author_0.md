What is labor productivity?

Formulate it in a energy context

List all the technologies that radically increased the labor productivity

How computers, Internet and AI productivity gains are measured, compared to stuff like fertilizers and assembly line?

The base of MDTC (the model...) definition of key technology is that the internet and computers are not the key technology - it doesn't have compared productivity effect as the stuff you listed before

So what key technologies do we have since 1950s?

Now you are getting it. This kind of plateu happened before, and that is the part of the Cycle of Development of Technologica civilization

No, the stuff that you described is more like the Kondratiev cycles. But the MDTC have another element - Smuta. This is a specific type of turmoil that happens when the speed of the development drops. Similar to how WW1, WW2, Great depression etc were kinda a future shock of speed of development being too big, the Smuta is opposite - it is the crash related to slowing down the emergence of the new technologies

Soviet 90s is a good example of Smuta. The other two are more of a pre-symptoms of the future post-2020 smuta. But I challenge you yo find an example earlier, hundreds of years before?

Roman empire - No, not so far

30 yw

Another key term in the MDTC is "favourable countries" - that's the countries, that would have much less trouble during smutas. It mostly happens because they barely benefited from previous rapid technological growth, so they kinda have "nowhere to fall". And also they have decent resource base in key resources compared to it's population 




Please from now use term like 1600s instead of 17 century

Another nuance is that smuta happens not simultaneously - it correlates with the speed of the development. In the 1900s Nazi Germany had the fastest development, and they burned out fast. Even if they won WW2 they were doomend to collapse in 1960s.

The USSR was also fast (but slower), so it collapsed in 1990s.

The West was even slower and is expected to collapse in 2020s

And there is another key terms - the SADAT - Space Available for Development with Achieved Technology level.

The smuta is started when certain entity (like a country) runs out of SADAT



Why are you marking India as a favourable country when the favourability is basicly SADAT divided by population? 



Your argumentation is good, but for Russia there is another factor: the favourability is calculated for the entity which is not always supposed to stay as one piece. The low-favourable countries tend to have big contadictions, e.g. low favourability states tend to conflict with high favourability. WDYT about these factors in Russia?


Okay, so un-favourabilitty comes in two types - "Harsh East" (high population, low SADAT) and "Wild west" (low population, high SADAT). So saying that favourability is just SADAT divided by population is a mistake - is more of a "golden middle"




So what is the verdict about Russia?



Well, in terms of MDTC Russia is actually a very unfavourable and will collapse. WDYT?
And again, please don't consider favourability as "locally good, gloablly bad" - if it's bad for the entity it collapses, and the stuff that emerges after are different entities out of scope of the original




No "internal balancing" excuses collapse - well actually it does, like USA is considered moderately favourable (it's a factor of historical unpredictability if it will collapse or not)

But in terms of Russia - it definitely will, like guess why they started the Ukraine war?



So now go from Europe west to east up to Kazakhstan and evaluate the favourability of the countries




I am not sure about France and Ukraine. You used some weird factors like Strong institutions and War accelerated SADAT loss and Infrastructure and cohesion critically damaged

it seems to be out of scope of MDTC and based on some other analytics


What about the other countries, do you have any corrections or it's fine?



So come again, when was the last previous worldwide smuta?




Do the favourability analysis for those times





You missed some importan stuff in europe (let's focus on it)
Some piece of Europe is still missing - that affected the world a lot after the smuta ended



WDYT - how naval technologies affect SADAT? Are they key ones?


Is movement labor? :D 


So remind me the Netherlands and Switzerland context in terms of people and technology migration
