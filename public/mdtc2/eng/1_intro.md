### Disclaimer

This theory is not fully formally proved at the moment. Some predictions are made, but it will quire years for world history to emerge to get the data to prove or disprove them. 

The theory implies that it also able to predict to the past, so another way to proved it is to get some more objective data (e.g. archeological), but it also takes time and barely predictable in terms of when it happens.
