# Stable Development

Stable Development is the final phase in the Model of Development of Technological Civilization (MDTC). It is characterized by a period of relative equilibrium, where societies rely on renewable resources and maintain slower, more sustainable progress.

Key features of the Stable Development phase:

- **Renewable resource reliance**: Societies transition to using renewable resources as the primary basis for their economies.
- **Decentralized stability**: Governance structures become more localized, with a focus on maintaining balance rather than rapid expansion.
- **Gradual technological progress**: Innovations occur at a slower pace, focusing on optimizing existing technologies rather than creating new key technologies.
- **Social cohesion**: Societies prioritize stability, equality, and long-term planning over short-term gains.

Stable Development represents a sustainable model of civilization, but it is also vulnerable to external shocks or the emergence of new Modern periods that disrupt the equilibrium.
